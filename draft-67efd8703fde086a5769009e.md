Moqui **framework** is a robust foundation to rapidly develop any type of software solution, Be it an ERP, a CMS, an E-Commerce store, a REST-api based backend, a Service, or an all in one Full-Stack Application.  
Moqui has tools and extensions for literally anything in software world, so it is upto your imagination, say system design capabilities that what you want to create.  
Using moqui as a core, developers can quickly scaffold enterprise grade products, deploy them quick and ship them fast.  
I intentionally made the word “framework” bold because moqui is a framework, a framework has a lot of inbuilt features to begin with and a developer customizes those features according to requirements.

## Features of Moqui

> use this list to get quick access of moqui capabilities when developing or brainstorming.

* Moqui runs on Java (no need to panic:) so it can be developed on any machine be it Windows, Mac, or Linux.
    
* Database flexibility, you can use any database of your choice be it MySQL, PostgreSQL, IBM DB2, Microsoft SQL Server etc. (there are other too, like H2, Derby, HSQL, Oracle database but i doubt you’ll use them (you shouldn’t)). Also other databases can be manually configured.
    
* Inbuilt transaction manager (java transactions api spec) and database connection pooling.
    
* Inbuilt server to serve the application (Jetty server by Eclipse) with customizability here as well.
    
* Command line tools using Gradle for data loading, database operations, server operations, logging and more (specified in build.gradle file on root directory of project).
    
* Moqui by default gives a web based interface, when started moqui starts a web server on specified port from where user and server management interfaces can be used. But this is not it, moqui can also be deployed as a embedded software for non-web apps, meaning with moqui, native desktop apps can be created using something other than the servlet.
    
* Everything runs from an instance of ExecutionContextFactory, meaning whatever runs on moqui can be accessed using executionContext, as name says, it is a method or object (hash map like object) from where we can access something and perform CRUD operations over that specific piece, giving developers granular control over the application.
    
* Execution Context with information about user and application context, and access to tools and Execution Context Factory used to get instances of the ExecutionContext and control the life cycle of the framework
    
* Various plugins available for GraphQL, React SSR, Localization, Docker, SFTP, Image Processing, Fop, CUPS (network printing), Elastic search and [more](https://github.com/moqui).
    
* Distributed Entity caching and invalidation, Distributed background service executor, Distributed notifications, Web session replication.
    
* Support for WebSockets using [JSR-356](https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/jsr356.html) API or moqui notification framework more on that [here](https://www.moqui.org/m/docs/framework/User+Interface/Notification+and+WebSocket).
    
* Email management support for incoming and outgoing emails.
    
* Inbuild profiling (performance testing) tools for framework artifacts including screens, services, and entities ( these are parts of moqui, more on this later).
    
* Inbuilt logging support, Inbuilt server status screen
    
* inbuilt authentication and authorization and complete user management, Protection against XSS and XSRF html attacks.
    
* JSON bases REST Api support, easy service (function) to REST Api mapping.
    
* Complete application monitoring tools to monitor whole and any part of the application.
    
* *And much more …*
    

## History of Moqui

Now after knowing such enormous number of inbuilt features and capabilities, you might doubt from where this project originated from, who made it, when was it made, how was it made, why it was made etc, i don’t know about yours but these questions are my primary questions when i see or get introduced to any new technology or tool,

> For me knowing the history of something makes me feel included and related to the technology in a way that a part of it, the original mindset of the developer stays with me, After knowing answers to these questions, it makes a lot of sense about the code written in the framework.
> 
> i am also new to this framework, but i will try to provide answers to these questions as far as i know according to my research.

​David E. Jones, the creator of Apache OFBiz, initiated the Moqui Framework project in 2011 to develop a modern, flexible, and open-source ERP and BPM framework. The name "Moqui" is derived from a Native American term referring to the Moqui people, symbolizing adaptability and flexibility. The project aimed to simplify the development of business applications by offering a refined and lightweight codebase compared to its predecessor, Apache OFBiz.

Moqui was officially released as an open-source project in 2012 and has since evolved, supported by a dedicated community of developers and users.

Why Moqui? you may ask as there was OFBiz already, well Moqui is capable to doing everything and more than OFBiz with only 40% of origin al
